# Quick Fix Applied

## Issues Found:
1. **OAuth Error**: `[object Object]` - Placeholder client ID in manifest.json
2. **CSP Error**: Firebase scripts blocked by Content Security Policy
3. **Firebase Loading**: External script loading not allowed in Chrome extensions

## Solution Applied:
âœ… **Minimal Auth Module** - Created `auth-minimal.js` with:
- No OAuth dependencies
- No Firebase dependencies  
- Simple test user creation
- Full console logging for debugging
- Clean UI integration

## What Should Happen Now:
1. **Reload the extension** in Chrome (`chrome://extensions/` â†’ refresh button)
2. **Open extension popup**
3. **Open browser console** (F12 â†’ Console tab)
4. **Click "ðŸ”‘ Sign In" button**

You should see:
- Console messages starting with "MinimalAuth:"
- A test user gets created
- User avatar appears in header
- Sign out button (Ã—) appears

## Console Messages to Look For:
```
MinimalAuth: Creating global instance...
MinimalAuth: Starting initialization...
MinimalAuth: Header found, creating auth UI
MinimalAuth: Sign in button clicked
MinimalAuth: Sign in started
MinimalAuth: Sign in completed successfully
```

## If It Still Doesn't Work:
Check for these common issues:
- Extension not reloaded after file changes
- JavaScript errors in console (unrelated to auth)
- DOM not fully loaded when auth tries to inject

## Next Steps After Testing:
Once the minimal auth works, we can:
1. Set up proper OAuth configuration
2. Add real Google Sign-In
3. Integrate with Firebase for user data storage

## Debug Commands:
Open console and try:
```javascript
// Check if auth module loaded
window.authModule

// Check current user
window.authModule.getCurrentUser()

// Manually trigger sign in
window.authModule.signIn()
```
